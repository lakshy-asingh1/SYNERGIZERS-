    <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
    <br>
    <span>“To learn programming is not simply to acquire a technical skill, but to develop a new way of thinking about problems, systems, and ideas. Every program we write defines a small universe of rules—rules that decide what is possible, what is expressible, and what is meaningful within that system. When we understand this, we begin to see that programming languages are not fixed tools we merely use, but flexible mediums we shape. At that moment, the learner transforms into a designer: someone who constructs frameworks for thought, not just solutions to tasks. In this sense, education in programming is education in abstraction, discipline, and creative reasoning, where writing code becomes an act of understanding rather than instruction.”</span>
